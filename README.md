# Tile-Map-Generator
Creates a randomized tile map.
The program is given height and width of the desired map, image prefix, number of images (n), and a file to write the map on. The next python file in the program will take this information and place the images onto the tiles. Images must be .gifs and be numbered 0 to n-1.
